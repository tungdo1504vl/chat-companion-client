# Partner Profile: Stitch - Design with AI

The **Partner Profile** is designed as a relationship assistant to help users manage important information, track key dates, and receive AI-driven insights to reduce the mental load of a relationship.

## 1. Overall Structure & Navigation

The profile uses a tab-based system to organize information.

- **Default Navigation**:
- **First-time users**: Default to **Tab 1 (Overview)**.

- **Returning users**: Default to **Tab 2 (Special Things)**.

- **Basic Info Header**: Includes the partner's Avatar (AI-generated, social profile, or upload), Name/Nickname, Age, City, and Relationship Stage.

## 2. Tab 1: Overview (Core Profile)

This section focuses on the partner’s personality, lifestyle, and the chemistry between the user and the partner.

- **Deal-Breakers (Manual)**: Includes items like dishonesty, ghosting, lack of respect, and misaligned goals.

- **Things They Appreciate (AI Inferred)**: Used to rewrite messages in the correct "tone" and suggest appropriate loving actions.

- **Lifestyle Snapshot (Mixed)**:
- **Work Rhythm**: 9-5, Flexible, or Remote.

## 3. Tab 2: Special Things

This tab helps users stay ahead of important dates and gift planning.

### Key Features

- **Special Days**: A list of dates including Birthdays (required), Relationship Start Date, Holidays (Christmas, Women's Day, etc.), and custom Private Days. Includes a countdown (e.g., "26 days left") and notification toggles.

- **Smart Gift Ideas (AI Curated)**: AI proposes gifts and experiences based on the partner's profile and upcoming events.

- **Gift Tags**: Items are tagged as "Top Pick," "Experience," "Thoughtful," or "Essentials".

- **Action Prompt**: A call-to-action banner (e.g., "Plan for Birthday?") to encourage early booking and preparation.

## 4. AI Rules & Mechanisms

- **Prediction Basis**: When data is missing, the AI analyzes public social content, conversation history, and behavior patterns (like reply time and tone).

- **UI Transparency**: All AI-generated items must feature a specific icon/badge and a tooltip: _"AI-inferred based on public social content. Accuracy may vary. You can edit or confirm."_.

- **User Control**: User edits always override AI-generated data.
